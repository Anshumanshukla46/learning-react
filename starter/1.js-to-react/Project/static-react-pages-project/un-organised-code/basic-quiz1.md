1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?
as react uses jsx because we have to convert our jsx file in js and can be done using react

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us.

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```
We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
declarative means just say what to do,
while imperative means have to tell what and how to do.

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger/greater than the individual pieces.
